# Welcome to capture the flag (Bash version)

"Capture the flag" (CTF) is a cybersecurity game where participants find flags (secret words or numbers) on a certain computer system. In this CTF, you will practice your basic knowledge of Bash and Git.

Flags take the form of a word enclosed in "FLAG" markers.

As a proper learning challenge to the exercise, only use the terminal to find the flags. If you use the editor, you will find all the answers by clicking around, which defeats the purpose of learning the terminal.

## Flag 1

Examine the commit log.

## Flag 2

Explore the repository a bit. Print out the file `flag.txt` on the console.

## Flag 3

Run the Bash file `message.sh` from the console, using `./message.sh`. This is how you run scripts and executables from the terminal.

## Flag 4

Read the source file of the README markdown.
